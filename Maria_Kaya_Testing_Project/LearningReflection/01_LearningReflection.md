> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing itself was nice but writing the test cases and bug report without any previous experience was extremely difficult.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I studied the example test cases and the assignment instructions, did the tests myself and filled the needed test cases and report
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     Personally I'm not a fan of Visual Studio Code so I would find a new way that is more clear


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
-  Visual Studio Code


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I wasn't sure what to do in many cases but tried to solve the problems from looking at the examples.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I don't like it much but I have managed to use it a few times.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
-  I have heard many people say good things about Robot Framework so I would like to try it.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
-  Analytical, logical and problem-solving abilities



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I would need to improve my programming skills and learn a lot more about the tools that are needed. Also, I would need to get rid off my dislike towards Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio
 (so far I have been doing most of my coding with Notepad++ as it's better for my simple and nervous brain)




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- I liked to try how the testing works and I don't mind reports either. Unfortunately, I had problems with understanding the assignment instructions and ran out of time
and it affected deeply the quality of my assignments. I would need easier, understandable examples but at least managed to even to try (even I was going to give up many times).
